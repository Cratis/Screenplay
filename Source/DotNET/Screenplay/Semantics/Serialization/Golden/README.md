# Golden vectors

The `full-esm-*.json` files pin canonical executable semantic model (ESM) bytes, including each model's semantic revision:

| File | Source model |
| --- | --- |
| `full-esm-v1.json` | `canonical_serialization_golden_vectors.CreateSemanticModel()` |
| `full-esm-v2.json` | `canonical_serialization_golden_vectors.CreateSemanticModelV2()` — typed destination, explicit specification event sources, and an audit identity occurrence mapping |
| `full-esm-v3.json` | `canonical_serialization_golden_vectors.CreateSemanticModelV3()` — the full v2 model plus a reducer-built read model with opaque transitions, a rule predicate, command code validation, and an opaque policy predicate |
| `full-esm-v4.json` | `canonical_serialization_golden_vectors.CreateSemanticModelV4()` — mixed ordinary and three-generation events, with historical tags and v4 transition cardinality |
| `full-esm-v5.json` | `canonical_serialization_golden_vectors.CreateSemanticModelV5()` — the v4 model plus one keyed read-model absence assertion |

The other files pin separate serialization contracts, not ESM bytes:

| File | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `full-expressions-v1.json` | `canonical_serialization_golden_vectors.CreateExpressions()` — expression variants |
| `full-identity-catalog-v1.json` | `canonical_serialization_golden_vectors.CreateIdentityCatalog()` — identity catalog with its own catalog revision |
| `typed-contexts-v1.json` | `when_describing_typed_contexts.GoldenBytes()` — typed-context descriptor sidecars for bound rule, policy, validation and reducer contexts |
| `unbound-handler-context-v1.json` | `when_describing_an_unbound_handler.GoldenBytes()` — typed-context descriptor sidecar for an unbound command handler |

The ESM, expression and identity-catalog sources live in `../given/canonical_serialization_golden_vectors*.cs`;
the typed-context sources live in the binder specs. Specs in this project compare the serialized sources
and descriptor sidecars with these bytes.

`Screenplay.CanonicalVectors.Specs.csproj` links eight of the nine files as embedded resources:
`full-esm-v1.json`, `full-esm-v2.json`, `full-esm-v3.json`, `full-esm-v4.json`, `full-esm-v5.json`,
`full-identity-catalog-v1.json`, `typed-contexts-v1.json`, and `unbound-handler-context-v1.json`.
It does not link `full-expressions-v1.json`. The vectors project checks ESM and identity-catalog
round trips and the presence of both descriptor sidecars. Do not edit the files by hand.

## Regenerating

When a deliberate contract change alters the canonical bytes, change the source model first, then run:

```bash
SCREENPLAY_REGENERATE_GOLDEN=1 dotnet test Source/DotNET/Screenplay/Screenplay.csproj -c Debug
```

For a v3-, v4- or v5-only regeneration, use `SCREENPLAY_REGENERATE_GOLDEN=3`, `SCREENPLAY_REGENERATE_GOLDEN=4` or `SCREENPLAY_REGENERATE_GOLDEN=5` with the same command. The `1` setting rewrites all nine files; all modes fail on purpose with
`GoldenVectorsRegenerated`, so it can never pass silently in CI. Review the diff, then rebuild and rerun
without the variable - the bytes are embedded at build time.

ESM vectors carry a semantic revision; the identity catalog carries its own catalog revision. Expression
and typed-context descriptor vectors are separate contracts, not ESM documents with semantic revisions.
An ESM serialization change can also change the expected ESM bytes and semantic revision of the corpus in
`Screenplay.CanonicalCorpus`, which this mechanism does not rewrite. Stage compares its output against that
corpus, so `Cratis.Screenplay` and `Cratis.Screenplay.CanonicalCorpus` must be released together for Stage.
