# Generated values and responses example (ESM v7)

A small model with a generated identifier, a second generated value, an ordered record response, a scalar
response, and specifications that pin both the emitted events and the response. It compiles with 0
diagnostics, binds, and its two specifications pass in the reference runner on Screenplay 4.68.0
(`Documentation/screenplay/fixtures/generated-responses.play` at `v4.68.0`). It needs the standalone
`screenplay` 4.68.0 or later: the cratis CLI 3.28.3 bundles 4.66.0, which does not bind these constructs
(`PLAY0268`), and `cratis render` does not render ESM v7 (Stage 4.24.2 refuses it with `STAGE-ESM-016`,
Cratis/tracked in Stage#201). Rules and refusals: [executable-subset.md](executable-subset.md#generated-values-and-responses-esm-v7).

          name = "Apollo"
        then returns "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
```

What each part pins:

- `for "<uuid>"` in `when` supplies the generated identifier's fixture; an indented `generated <name> = <value>` supplies any other generated value. Neither is a request input.
- `then returns` with a named field asserts a subset of the record; `then returns "<uuid>"` asserts a scalar response.
- Without a fixture for a reached generated value the run is `Unsupported(IdentityAllocation)` and the specification never passes.
